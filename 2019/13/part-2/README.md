# Part Two

The game didn't run because you didn't put in any quarters. Unfortunately, you did not bring any quarters. Memory address 0 represents the number of quarters that have been inserted; set it to 2 to play for free.

The arcade cabinet has a joystick that can move left and right. The software reads the position of the joystick with input instructions:

    If the joystick is in the neutral position, provide 0.
    If the joystick is tilted to the left, provide -1.
    If the joystick is tilted to the right, provide 1.

The arcade cabinet also has a segment display capable of showing a single number that represents the player's current score. When three output instructions specify X=-1, Y=0, the third output instruction is not a tile; the value instead specifies the new score to show in the segment display. For example, a sequence of output values like -1,0,12345 would show 12345 as the player's current score.

Beat the game by breaking all the blocks. What is your score after the last block is broken?
