# Part Two

After collecting ORE for a while, you check your cargo hold: 1 trillion (1000000000000) units of ORE.

With that much ore, given the examples above:

    The 13312 ORE-per-FUEL example could produce 82892753 FUEL.
    The 180697 ORE-per-FUEL example could produce 5586022 FUEL.
    The 2210736 ORE-per-FUEL example could produce 460664 FUEL.

Given 1 trillion ORE, what is the maximum amount of FUEL you can produce?
